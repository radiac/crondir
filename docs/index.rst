Simplifies the automated management of cron tasks in the user space. Files are added to
and removed from a cron dir in the user's home, and then concatenated into the crontab.

- Store and manages crontab definitions in separate files
- Does not interfere with existing crontab entries
- Backs up crontab each time it builds
- Everything configurable
